# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in improving the Markdown Live Preview app at md.airat.top. Contributions of all kinds are welcome, including bug reports, documentation improvements, and UI or UX polish.

## How to Help

- **Report bugs or suggest enhancements** by opening an issue on GitHub. Please include clear reproduction steps, your browser and OS, and any console errors.
- **Improve documentation** by fixing typos or clarifying usage details in the README.
- **Submit pull requests** for HTML, CSS, or JavaScript improvements, accessibility, or performance tweaks.

## Before You Start

- Read the repository `README.md` to understand the project goals and constraints.
- Keep changes focused. If you have multiple unrelated ideas, open separate pull requests.
- This is a static site with no build step. Keep dependencies minimal and avoid adding external services or trackers.

## Development Workflow

1. Fork the repository and clone your fork locally.
2. Create a feature branch that describes your work (for example, `feature/better-shortcuts`).
3. Make your changes and keep commits scoped and meaningful.
4. Validate the changes locally by opening `index.html` in your browser.
5. Check both light and dark modes, and verify layout on narrow screens.
6. Open a pull request against the `main` branch and describe what changed and how you verified it.

## Pull Request Checklist

- [ ] The app works by opening `index.html` directly (no build step required).
- [ ] No console errors in the browser.
- [ ] Changes are tested in at least one modern browser.
- [ ] UI changes behave well on small screens and in dark mode.
- [ ] Documentation updated if user-facing behavior changed.

## Code Style and Standards

- Keep the project lightweight and easy to run locally.
- Use clear, readable vanilla JavaScript and CSS that matches existing style.
- Prefer accessibility-friendly patterns (keyboard use, contrast, focus states).

## Security and Responsible Disclosure

If you discover a security vulnerability, please do not open a public issue. Instead, email [mail@airat.top](mailto:mail@airat.top) with the details so it can be addressed promptly.
